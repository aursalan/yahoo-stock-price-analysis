# Yahoo Stock Price Analysis

This project performs a **time series analysis** of Yahoo’s stock price using Jupyter Notebook. The notebook reads stock price data from a CSV file, preprocesses it into a structured NumPy array, and then visualises the data with Matplotlib.

The analysis includes:
- Loading and parsing Yahoo stock price data from CSV.
- Converting the raw dataset into a structured NumPy array for efficient handling.
- Cleaning the dataset by removing headers and preparing it for analysis.
- Plotting stock price trends over time using Matplotlib to observe fluctuations and patterns.

The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how simple yet powerful tools like **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Python’s CSV** module can be applied to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on financial datasets.

## How to Install and Run the Project

This project was built and tested entirely on **Kaggle Notebook.**

To run it yourself:
- Go to [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Upload the provided Jupyter Notebook file: ```yahoo-stock-price-analysis.ipynb.```
- Load dataset [Yahoo Stock Price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aursalan/yahoo-stock-price) into the Kaggle environment.
- Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

**No additional setup is required since Kaggle comes with NumPy and Matplotlib pre-installed.**

## How to Use the Project

Once you run the notebook, you will be able to:

- View stock price plots.
- Observe Average Stock Closing Price by Year
